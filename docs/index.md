# Preamble {-#preamble}

This is an excerpt of a longer document: *A guide for Ph.D. students.* Thus, it was written specifically for that type of occupation. However, I am sure you can find useful  information that you may want to implement to your job, specially, if you are working on an office seated in front of a screen most of your day.
