Carlito Fluito 2020-05-03 Preamble This is a short, straight to the point guide with life advice. I have collected some of my favourite practices, routines and exercises to keep me fully alive and functioning. I donâ€™t dwell much in any of the topics, since there are tons of wonderfull sources around the Internet. Therefore, the goal is to give you some ideas, and spark your mind. We are living in 2020, and this is an interactive world: I am a Sapiens in front of a screen and you are a Sapiens in front of a screen. Contact me if you have suggestions, improvements, or if you want resources about a specific habit. The guide is updated periodically with the new practices and habits that I find useful or worthwhile trying. About the content Because of how much I like to write, I oftenly spend too much time seated at my desk. Thus, if you have an occupation that requires you to stay seated for long periods of time, you will find a lot of value in the first part of the guide Workflow, where I give advice about desk jobs. If you workplace is shared with fellow sapiens, the second part Be social will give you some extra tips about how to reach and connect with the colleges around your work. In Take Breaks, you can find my personal improved techniques for sustaining high levels of energy and focus throughout the day. And finally, the best part Boost your life, which I have divided in: Brain caring Body caring Dietary caring Soul caring In this last section you will find a lot of attitudes, mindsets, lifestyles, daily practices, and radical changes, that have completely transformed my life from an unfulfilled Ph.D. student to a flourishing full-time artist and spiritual psychologist with a non-Ph.D. qualification.

With gratitude and love, Carlito Fluito This is a bookdown book Bookdown is the best tool that I have found so far to self-publish my written ideas. It is very intuitive and user friendly. In the menu above, from left to right, you can hide or show the index, search for a word, change the format of reading1, or download the content in PDF and EPUB, so you can read it offline. At the right side of the screen, you will find that bird, that f, and that share icon that would make me so honour and happy. The goal of every writer is to be read. Therefore, the most enjoyable is your experience, and the more people you share the content with, the more I would have reached my goal. Thanks for helping me grow. I am a big fan of dark themes.â†© "]
