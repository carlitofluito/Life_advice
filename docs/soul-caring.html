<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.4</span> Soul caring</h2>
<p>I am aiming to become a spiritual psychologist, whatever that means and no matter if that exists or not. Curiously, it is somehow reiterative, since the whole discipline is called psychology (psycho – soul, logos – knowledge). Thus, a soul or spiritual psychologist is someone that specializes on the study of the soul’s soul. Anyway, I don’t think all psycho-socio-cultural, physio-bio-neurological processes concerning human spirituality (whatever that means) are not very well researched. There is a big debate about what is and what is not spiritual, but this is not the place for these discussions. I got specialized in positive psychology, psychology of religion, moral psychology, and environmental psychology, so let’s imagine that a inputs from these disciplines can be easily related with human spirituality.</p>
<div id="explore-your-consciousness" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.4.1</span> Explore your consciousness</h3>
<p>Meditation is the key tool for observing the workings and functioning of your own mind. From the most basic exercise of attention to the breathing, and observing your body, to those more esoteric one concerning energies, and visualizations, feel free of developing alternative mind states. Scientific or not, nobody is being hurt because you try. If it works for you, shouldn’t you use it because there is no scientific evidence? When we behave as individuals we don’t have to be academics, we can also enjoy our beliefs without knowing the working mechanism.</p>
<p>There is also a wide list of other practices you can do to explore your consciousness. Some of them are through sounds, like mantras, ohms and gong baths. Some are through your body, like ecstatic dance or physical stimulation. Some are through the environment, by feelings of awe in the nature. Some are with other people, by making love and having orgasms. Some are with external substances, like trying psychedelics. Don’t think that your daily state of consciousness, the way you often perceive reality is the only way that exists, or it is the right, proper way. After all, in our civilization it is common to drink coffee in the morning to feel more alert, alcohol in the evening to socialize, and watching a film to relax. So, why shouldn’t you go a step forward sand find out what is the best practice for your type of brain to set up your consciousness in the desired state for a given situation? My little warning is that you explore your consciousness consciously. You probably don’t want to be as crazier than the craziest, but just crazier than the sanest.</p>
</div>
<div id="prioritize-love" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.4.2</span> Prioritize love</h3>
<p>Use love as a guiding principle in your life. Love the things you do and love the people you are with. Try not to buy the lies of the economic system that suggest that sacrificing social relationship to get individual goals will bring you happiness and fulfillment. Wellbeing’s key component is other people. Invest in your social relationships and dare to go further. Aim to develop meaningful and long-lasting bonds with people that understand and supports you. Isolation is dreadful and feeling lonely can be the beginning of a downward spiral where you may lose the motivation for doing anything else. Use your feelings as a guide for selecting the people and the things you want to do. As my advisor used to say after asking me a long list of to-do-items for next week’s meeting: “<em>There is only one life.</em>” Use it wisely.</p>
</div>
<div id="do-what-you-love-and-love-what-you-do" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.4.3</span> Do what you love and love what you do</h3>
<p>Related with the previous. Aim to spend as much time as possible doing what you love WITH the people you love, and you will have a lovely life. However, sometimes we cannot do only the things we love. There are tasks and chores that are not our favorites, and if you don’t have human or robotic slaves, you may have to spend some time queuing alone at the supermarket, hanging wet clothes, or dishing. In these cases, try to love what you are doing. Find the interesting aspects of the task, practice mindfulness, raise your awareness about the situation where you are in, play with your emotions and consciousness, or simply play some music or an interesting podcast. If you cannot do what you love, try to love what you do.</p>
<ul>
<li>Gratitude journal</li>
</ul>
<p>The most researched and scientifically sound practice of positive psychology. It will help you be more attentive with other people, and value the small details of life. It can strengthen your social relationship and keep you going during hard times.</p>
<ul>
<li>Have a purpose</li>
</ul>
<p>It seems we have all our needs cover in our WEIRD societies <span class="citation">(Henrich, Heine, and Norenzayan <a href="#ref-henrich2010weirdest" role="doc-biblioref">2010</a>)</span>. However, I realized that once the basic physiological needs are cover, people lack other things. In my case, I reduced my living needs to air, water, food, people, love and purpose. I have already mentioned people and love in different parts of the text. For some of human, people can serve as a source of meaning and purpose, like having a kid, or a family to raise. However, some of us need to go a step beyond and feel that we are creating something bigger than ourselves, something that will survive our deaths. Thus, try to find an activity that you can feel proud of doing, try to create something that will make you be remembered as someone that improve the quality of the rest of fellow humans in the planet. You can research about the positive effects of living a meaningful life, or just experience it subjectively. Anyway, wasting one’s time and life, and entertaining oneself to death can oftentimes feel empty and shallow. Occupy your time with something that fills your soul.</p>
</div>
<div id="be-creative-artistic-and-culturally-active" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.4.4</span> Be creative, artistic and culturally active</h3>
<p>If you like human beings, you probably like art. Consider art as an alternative way of expression and communication. Delve into the richness and variety of artistic expressions of our current times. Also, feel welcomed to contribute creating your own pieces of work. It is a worthwhile invest, since automation job replacement may leave most of us without an occupation in the upcoming years. However, even if artificial intelligences are better music composer, designers or painters than humans, Sapiens love creativity by itself, not just for the product, but also for the process of creation and self-discovery. Thus, I think artist and professions related with the arts and creativity are ones with a lot of future. Start early.</p>
</div>
<div id="remain-curious" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.4.5</span> Remain curious</h3>
<p>Life is what happens between you are born and you die. In between, there is a whole infinite space of ignorance to fill. You will never know anything, but don’t be overwhelmed and think that it is not worthwhile to invest in learning. Seek for knowledge, seek for wisdom. Curiosity is the antidote for apathy and boredom. There is always something to discover, something to learn, something to perfectionate. Keep your curiosity alive, and you will keep reducing the amount of infinite ignorance along your existence.</p>
</div>
<div id="travel-consciously" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.4.6</span> Travel consciously</h3>
<p>Our hunter-gathered brains thrive by discovering new things. Travelling will broaden your perspectives about human beings, and the planet Earth. However, taking planes have an environmental cost and doing tourism in developing countries can be a form of exploitation. Nevertheless, the more you travel, the more you may develop empathy for people different than you, and the more you may feel moved by their lives and aim to change the inequality. Try to develop this type of global consciousness. Besides, if you acquired the habit of minimalism, travelling becomes a much easier and uncomplicated experience. In my case, I have a turban from Morocco that has multifunction (hat, blanket, towel, improvised bag, skirt…). If you go vegan or fruitarian, you may find difficulties and limitations in some countries. However, fruits in tropical countries taste amazing, maybe because the palatals, tongues and digestive system of our phylogenetic ancestors developed in these types of climates… Give it a thought.</p>
</div>
<div id="track-your-expenses" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.4.7</span> Track your expenses</h3>
<p>Money may not be considered as very spiritual for many of us. However, it is a practical tool and it allow us to navigate the complexities of the social world we live in. Thus, a basic tip is to keep a Excel sheet where you can record your expenses. It will help you become more conscious of how you are using the money, correct some possible misusing, and detect potential addictions. Also, you will need some savings if you want to successfully escape the system.</p>
</div>
<div id="dont-complain-become-proactive." class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.4.8</span> Don’t complain, become proactive.</h3>
<p>People complain often about the situation that they leave. Public transport is late, the weather is bad, things don’t work and so on. I try to reduce the number of complains I make daily, and try to find alternatives for the different situations and always look at the brighter side of life. I am not saying you take a naive and conformist approach to life, but give a thought to the things you can change and those that you cannot. I am not saying the punctuality of the trains is not annoying, I am saying that if it annoys you enough, you become proactive and start a campaign for change it.</p>
<p>An intelligent thing I read about our hyper-busy society was to start substituting the “<em>I don’t have time</em>”answer with the “<em>It is not a priority at this moment</em>”. This way you may found yourself more relaxed about your life, and reduce complains about the amount of things you have to do.</p>
<p>Many people could say that I life in a ubiquitous complain about civilization and the system. They are not incorrect. However, my proactivity lays in developing and spreading my complains in a more thoughtful and elaborate format, and ultimately, suggesting some possible solutions and actions towards the betterment of the situation.</p>
<p>About the weather, don’t be like China and force changes on it, in exchange of droughts in the nearby of the city. And if the weather is too bad, try moving to another country. Maybe a tropical one, because, you know Sapiens developed in tropical and subtropical countries and all that.</p>
</div>
<div id="move-out-from-civilization---go-primitive-go-to-nature" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.4.9</span> Move out from civilization - Go primitive, go to nature</h3>
<p>I don’t want to develop much in this point, since at this moment of my life is one of my favorite topics. Check Civilized to Death by Christopher Ryan. As a I wrote in a recent letter, most of us live a life deprived of healthy levels of:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>nature,</p></li>
<li><p>fresh air,</p></li>
<li><p>clean water,</p></li>
<li><p>nourishing foods,</p></li>
<li><p>sleep,</p></li>
<li><p>love,</p></li>
<li><p>meaningful social connections,</p></li>
<li><p>social support,</p></li>
<li><p>sex,</p></li>
<li><p>fun,</p></li>
<li><p>free time,</p></li>
<li><p>creative opportunities,</p></li>
<li><p>loving education.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>On the other hand, we are likely having too much of:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>food,</p></li>
<li><p>clothes,</p></li>
<li><p>commodities,</p></li>
<li><p>responsibilities,</p></li>
<li><p>sources of stress,</p></li>
<li><p>cleanliness,</p></li>
<li><p>mutated viruses,</p></li>
<li><p>material things,</p></li>
<li><p>irrelevant information.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Reconsider the conditions of your life, reconsider living a sickening system, reconsider living more accordingly to your true human ape nature. My aim is to develop a community of people that I love with whom I can do the things I love to do. Living minimalistic, vegan and in constant connection with the nature. We’ll use civilization advances as little as possible and enjoy our living time as best as possible. As Zizek suggest, protesting may be a form of sustaining and collaborating on the perpetuating of the system. In a similar line, I detected that spiritual and positive psychologist practices (the ones I suggest you to practice in this guide) can be also become tools of the system to keep people civilized and functioning.</p>
<p>It may seem risky, dangerous, and scary, but dare to change if that is what your heart is asking you to do.</p>
<p>If you have made it this far, I already consider you one of “<em>My people</em>”. So, it is time for a bit of obvious and open self-promotion. If what I preach resonates with you, go ahead and support my journey. Subscribing to the YouTube channel, following me on social media, or visiting my website from time to time to check what I have published is already a big action from your part. I will be hugely thanked for it.</p>
<p>I don’t have email list yet, working on it. I have some merchandise that is not fully promoted. I also have a <a href="https://www.patreon.com/carlitofluito">Patreon website</a>, if you feel economically abundant and you want to help me continuing my journey. I haven’t published books with any editorial and my writings are free and accessible for the moment. Growing and improving step by step. Thanks for your patience.</p>
<p>Enjoy the research! :-)</p>
<p>With love,</p>
<p>Carlos Alcala a.k.a. Carlito Fluito, non-Ph.D.</p>
